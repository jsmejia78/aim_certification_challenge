Here\\\\\\'s how. 1. Start by committing to model a respectful tone. If you\\\\\\'re yelling, stop. Really. Kids lose respect for parents who yell, so you have less influence. They also learn that yelling is how to express emotions and solve problems, so they yell, too. It\\\\\\'s not necessary to yell to get your child\\\\\\'s attention if you have a good relationship. 2. Focus on strengthening the relationship. Start by listening. Your goal is a strong relationship, where your child feels seen, heard, understood and valued. That way, your child will tell you the truth and will want to share with you. And when you set a limit (\"Homework before screen time!\") or express an expectation (\"We speak civilly in this house\") your child will want to cooperate. Make sure you have one-on-one time with each child every day, in which you mostly listen. Train yourself not to overreact when your child shares something with you. If your child is \"too busy\" to connect, give foot massages and connect through her passions, for instance by listening to her music with her. You can\\\\\\'t hope to have any influence if your kid doesn\\\\\\'t enjoy being with you. 3. Help your child develop good judgment by reflecting on her actions. to develop the executive function skills of the prefrontal cortex, try asking good questions.

Questions work infinitely better than lectures. Try to calm yourself first, so your tone is warm, supportive and curious. If your child feels judged, shamed, or that punishment is looming, there will be no learning, and probably no honest answers. \"What were you wanting to have happen when you did this?\" \"Was there some part of you that said \\\\\\'Don\\\\\\'t do this\\\\\\'?\" \"What got into the way of you listening to that part of you?\" \"How did that work out for you?\" \"How did it work out for other people involved?\" \"What else could you have done?\" \"Right, you could have done X...how do you think that would have worked out? What would have happened then?\" 4. Resist threats and punishment. Self discipline develops when the child CHOOSES to give up what they want for something they want more. What do they want more? To have a good relationship with you, to trust you, to know they can count on your love even when they mess up. That is the \"roots\" that allows them to spread their \"wings\" and learn to fly safely. So focus on the relationship instead of punishment. What about \"giving\" consequences? That\\\\\\'s punishment. \"You should have done your homework last night. Next time I see you doing a rush job in the morning like this, you lose your screen time later today.\" This parent is concerned, naturally, about her child. But this approach has some unintended consequences.\\'), Document(metadata={\\'source\\': \\'/home/jsmejia/the_ai_eng_bootcamp/code/aim_certification_challenge/data/pd_blogs_filtered/data_tweens_and_preteens_10-12/003_Help Your Child Develop Good Judgment.txt\\', \\'_id\\': \\'1547114cc13c49e3acbcb110e1bda9eb\\', \\'_collection_name\\': \\'Rag Loaded Data Baseline\\'}, page_content=\\'But you’ll need to change before we go to services, because there we dress up to show respect.

Here\\\\\\'s how. 1. Start by committing to model a respectful tone. If you\\\\\\'re yelling, stop. Really. Kids lose respect for parents who yell, so you have less influence. They also learn that yelling is how to express emotions and solve problems, so they yell, too. It\\\\\\'s not necessary to yell to get your child\\\\\\'s attention if you have a good relationship. 2. Focus on strengthening the relationship. Start by listening. Your goal is a strong relationship, where your child feels seen, heard, understood and valued. That way, your child will tell you the truth and will want to share with you. And when you set a limit (\"Homework before screen time!\") or express an expectation (\"We speak civilly in this house\") your child will want to cooperate. Make sure you have one-on-one time with each child every day, in which you mostly listen. Train yourself not to overreact when your child shares something with you. If your child is \"too busy\" to connect, give foot massages and connect through her passions, for instance by listening to her music with her. You can\\\\\\'t hope to have any influence if your kid doesn\\\\\\'t enjoy being with you. 3.

Here\\\\\\'s how. 1. Start by committing to model a respectful tone. If you\\\\\\'re yelling, stop. Really. Kids lose respect for parents who yell, so you have less influence. They also learn that yelling is how to express emotions and solve problems, so they yell, too. It\\\\\\'s not necessary to yell to get your child\\\\\\'s attention if you have a good relationship. 2. Focus on strengthening the relationship. Start by listening. Your goal is a strong relationship, where your child feels seen, heard, understood and valued. That way, your child will tell you the truth and will want to share with you. And when you set a limit (\"Homework before screen time!\") or express an expectation (\"We speak civilly in this house\") your child will want to cooperate. Make sure you have one-on-one time with each child every day, in which you mostly listen. Train yourself not to overreact when your child shares something with you. If your child is \"too busy\" to connect, give foot massages and connect through her passions, for instance by listening to her music with her. You can\\\\\\'t hope to have any influence if your kid doesn\\\\\\'t enjoy being with you. 3.

Questions work infinitely better than lectures. Try to calm yourself first, so your tone is warm, supportive and curious. If your child feels judged, shamed, or that punishment is looming, there will be no learning, and probably no honest answers. \"What were you wanting to have happen when you did this?\" \"Was there some part of you that said \\\\\\'Don\\\\\\'t do this\\\\\\'?\" \"What got into the way of you listening to that part of you?\" \"How did that work out for you?\" \"How did it work out for other people involved?\" \"What else could you have done?\" \"Right, you could have done X...how do you think that would have worked out? What would have happened then?\" 4. Resist threats and punishment. Self discipline develops when the child CHOOSES to give up what they want for something they want more. What do they want more? To have a good relationship with you, to trust you, to know they can count on your love even when they mess up. That is the \"roots\" that allows them to spread their \"wings\" and learn to fly safely. So focus on the relationship instead of punishment. What about \"giving\" consequences? That\\\\\\'s punishment. \"You should have done your homework last night.

Do you yourself ever take a magazine you like? Do you ever take pens, pads or other supplies from work? Do you tell your boss when you think she’s asking you to do something that borders on unethical? Do you ever lie about your child\\'s age to get the lower admission price? Do you regularly give some portion of your income to charity? Is it hard to believe that this test can predict your child\\'s behavior? Researchers confirm that children learn what we do, not what we say. So the first part of helping your child to develop moral courage is to develop your own. The second , of course, is paying attention to all the teachable moments. Not to lecture, but to recognize, aloud, how hard the choice is. And to ask your child what they will consider as they make the choice. How do they want to see themselves? What kind of person do they want to be? The third part of supporting your child to develop moral courage is remembering that kids develop courage along with maturity, over time. Don\\'t take it too hard when your child doesn\\'t display the courage you\\'d like.

To have a good relationship with you, to trust you, to know they can count on your love even when they mess up. That is the \"roots\" that allows them to spread their \"wings\" and learn to fly safely. So focus on the relationship instead of punishment. What about \"giving\" consequences?

Not much fun to have to rush like that, is it? It also means it\\\\\\'s harder to do your best work and catch your mistakes. Let\\\\\\'s figure out a way for you to finish your homework at night so you don\\\\\\'t feel so stressed in the morning.....\" The natural result of not getting her homework done the night before is having to rush to do it in the morning. If you can help her notice that effect herself -- instead of using threats and control, which will just make her rebel -- she\\\\\\'s more likely to take responsibility to act on that knowledge. What if your child doesn\\\\\\'t step up and handle himself responsibly? Very common, especially where screen usage is concerned.

Questions work infinitely better than lectures. Try to calm yourself first, so your tone is warm, supportive and curious. If your child feels judged, shamed, or that punishment is looming, there will be no learning, and probably no honest answers. \"What were you wanting to have happen when you did this?\" \"Was there some part of you that said \\\\\\'Don\\\\\\'t do this\\\\\\'?\" \"What got into the way of you listening to that part of you?\" \"How did that work out for you?\" \"How did it work out for other people involved?\" \"What else could you have done?\" \"Right, you could have done X...how do you think that would have worked out? What would have happened then?\" 4. Resist threats and punishment. Self discipline develops when the child CHOOSES to give up what they want for something they want more. What do they want more? To have a good relationship with you, to trust you, to know they can count on your love even when they mess up. That is the \"roots\" that allows them to spread their \"wings\" and learn to fly safely. So focus on the relationship instead of punishment. What about \"giving\" consequences? That\\\\\\'s punishment. \"You should have done your homework last night. Next time I see you doing a rush job in the morning like this, you lose your screen time later today.\" This parent is concerned, naturally, about her child. But this approach has some unintended consequences.\\'), Document(metadata={\\'source\\': \\'/home/jsmejia/the_ai_eng_bootcamp/code/aim_certification_challenge/data/pd_blogs_filtered/data_tweens_and_preteens_10-12/005_How to Get Your Child to LISTEN.txt\\', \\'_id\\': \\'b368aa9d3aec44d58ffc275b8ccd90bd\\', \\'_collection_name\\': \\'Rag Loaded Data Baseline\\'}, page_content=\\'go into fight or flight.
