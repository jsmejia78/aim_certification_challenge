            "3. Set Clear Expectations and Consequences: Let your child know kindly but firmly that whining is not acceptable, and if it continues, you may choose to ignore the whining to avoid reinforcing it.\n",

            "4. Redirect and Teach Alternatives: Gently redirect their behavior and teach them how to express their needs or feelings in a respectful, calm way.\n",

            "5. Model the Behavior: Show them how to handle frustration or disappointment with calmness and respectful communication.\n",

The goal is to help children feel understood and supported, encouraging them to develop better communication skills rather than resorting to whining.
